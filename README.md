# Data-Engineering-Project

Project: Data Ingestion and Pipeline with Google Cloud, Docker, and Tableau Visualization

1. Data Ingestion and Batch Processing:
   - Identify and gather relevant data sources related to transportation, income per region, housing cost per region, service goods near regions, race per region, cost of living per region, and wages per region in Southern California.
   - Set up data ingestion process to retrieve the data from various sources and bring it into the pipeline.
   - Develop batch processing workflows using tools like Apache Airflow or Prefect to orchestrate the data pipeline.

2. Docker and Containerization:
   - Utilize Docker containers to package the pipeline components and ensure consistency and reproducibility of the deployment.
   - Create Docker images for each step of the pipeline, including data ingestion, transformation, and loading.

3. Data Lake and BigQuery:
   - Set up a data lake storage solution, such as Google Cloud Storage, to store the ingested data in its raw format.
   - Develop a schema and partitioning strategy in BigQuery that makes sense for efficient data querying and downstream transformations.
   - Utilize BigQuery's clustering feature to organize data in the tables based on columns commonly used together in queries, improving query performance.

4. Transformation with PySpark:
   - Define transformation logic using PySpark, a powerful distributed processing framework for big data.
   - Apply data cleaning, normalization, aggregation, enrichment, and any other necessary transformations using PySpark.
   - Leverage the PySpark API to interact with the data stored in the data lake and perform the required transformations.

5. Tableau Visualization:
   - Set up Tableau as the data visualization tool to provide interactive and insightful dashboards and reports.
   - Connect Tableau to the transformed data in BigQuery to create visualizations based on the different data dimensions, such as transportation, income, housing cost, service goods, race, cost of living, and wages per region in Southern California.
   - Develop interactive visualizations, charts, and maps to showcase the data in a user-friendly manner.

6. Automation and Monitoring:
   - Implement monitoring and alerting mechanisms to track the health and performance of the pipeline.
   - Schedule batch processing jobs to run at specific intervals or trigger them based on data availability or events.
   - Utilize logging and monitoring tools like Stackdriver or Prometheus to collect and analyze pipeline metrics and logs.

7. Deployment and Scaling:
   - Deploy the infrastructure components required for the pipeline on Google Cloud, such as virtual machines or Kubernetes clusters.
   - Utilize infrastructure as code tools like Terraform or Deployment Manager to automate the provisioning and management of the cloud resources.
   - Design the system with scalability in mind to handle increased data volumes and accommodate future growth.

By combining Google Cloud, Docker containers, BigQuery, PySpark, and Tableau, this project enables you to ingest, transform, and visualize transportation, income, housing cost, service goods, race, cost of living, and wages data per region in Southern California. The pipeline ensures data integrity, scalability, and efficient querying for analytical insights and decision-making.P
